Art 107 Project 5 Remix Video
This is a Premiere Pro Project
Objectives:
To take part in the basics of video editing.
To explore the relationship between video and audio.
To creatively use found footage to create a compelling video remix.

My Idea on this Project:
I choose three videos of Chinese e-sport players from LOL, PUBG and CSGO and added a Travis Scott like bam and bass to highlight moments

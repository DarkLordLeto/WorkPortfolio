Art 107 Project 2 Throwback Collage
This is a PhotoShop Project which has following requirements:
Full Color Compositions done in Photoshop. You are encouraged to create these compositions as two variations on a theme or idea. Your compositions should be 8 x 11 at 300ppi, in RGB color mode. Save your compositions as JPEG files

In this project, I took inspiration from two of my favorite albums: The Life of Pablo by Kanye West and Testing by Asap Rocky and created 2 Y2k style collage poster.}
